57502af3-01fb-11e7-a2f0-000c29dba5da,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Messenger does not work in this wrapper and for a long time just clicking on the icon crashed the app. Now that is gone but with the latest version the screen goes white when clicking on a link. When ones goes back another page is loaded and so you can't follow down your time-line. Used to like it a lot for years but right now it is unusable.,#3,,,

7c2a3142-afc9-11e6-a0f3-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Was good  but doesn't work right anymore I honestly think it's Facebook sabotaging apps like this  first with the messaging crashing the app. But  now it messes up while typing. It's a bit difficult to explain  but it erases letters & replaces them to the point that you can't write a coherent sentence without taking extra effort to fix it.,#5,#5,,
7c2a39c7-afc9-11e6-90e7-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Was good  but slipping It was great for a while  then started crashing when you try to read messages. Then it would show notification alert  but the notifications weren't there until refresh. Now it's decided I don't have any friends & should get some so it can show me things  even though it still shows I have 200+,#5,,,

7c2a3e59-afc9-11e6-858b-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Crashes on Messages I would give this 5 stars but it crashes every time I try to access my messages in the app. I have removed and reinstalled the app  signed in and out  even reformatted my phone. But it still crashes when I click Messages  every time without fail.,#5,,,
7c2a3edc-afc9-11e6-95db-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Great for low memory phones Lets face it. The official FB app keeps getting more bloated with every useless update  and then forcing Messenger on us to IM people was a dumb move. Luckily this app fixes all of that. It's all in one  the way it should be. Theres a couple little things that I'd gripe about but its nothing compared to how the official app is  lol. Edit (23 Oct 2016): had to switch to another app since messages don't work anymore. The app will either force close or go to Play store.,#5,,,
7c2a40e3-afc9-11e6-a81d-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,app crashes every time I open messages or try to message  which means I just have to use fb messenger which sucks but whatever still a good easy app,#5,,,

7c2a483a-afc9-11e6-8170-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,It's a great app but It's a great app but it crashes when I open messages and that was the main reason I installed it  so I could avoid having to use messenger. I might as well install the official Facebook app,#5,,,
7c2a4bab-afc9-11e6-8194-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Crashes every time wit FB personal message I prefer this app to FB but it is a nuisance that it crashes every time I attempt to access personal messages that are apparently waiting for me. This bug is consistent across my two devices. I see other users have reported the same frustrating problem but the developer shows no interest in fixing it. I hope they do fix it  as it is otherwise useful.,#5,,,
7c2a5105-afc9-11e6-af58-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Great app  but Facebook are slowly breaking it First Facebook blocked the API for messaging  so the app crashes every time you try to access it  and now it seems like they've blocked events as well. Any chance of a fix or workaround? Managing events is pretty much the main reason I use Facebook.,#5,,,

7c2a5821-afc9-11e6-840a-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Decent Facebook app I've been using this app for a few years. I begun using it because the size is smaller than the official app and also the privacy. But I've stayed with it because it barely glitches and is still fast and doesn't take up much space. I would give it 5 stars but the app crashes every time I try to check my messages on it,#5,,,
7c2a5cb3-afc9-11e6-84f4-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Could be better Why can't I copy pages as links to paste into other threads  there should be the option to do that. Plus messages are broken and crash the app everytime I try to view them. This may be something fb have done in trying to force everyone to download their awful app but could that also be looked at?,#5,,,
7c2a5f17-afc9-11e6-be5d-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Great Small ram footprint  much faster  and privacy! However mine seems to crash when I tap the messages icon on top,#5,,,

For me  it almost defeats the purpose of having this app since I will have to get the FB messenger app to read them anyway without my computer.

UPDATED: Having to uninstall  sadly  because it crashes every time I try to open messaging. Not uninstalling for that alone - that's kind of the last straw. PREVIOUS 3 stars  So far I like the idea and intent  but like some others have mentioned  push notifications would be great. Plus  I've had a couple use problems already in first day  including having the app choke while trying to post a picture and shutting down entirely when trying to access the message section. We'll see how things continue...,#5,,,

7c2a7f00-afc9-11e6-abae-c4b301cdf627,com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Good except for messages The app was a real good alternative to Facebook. I hate that Facebook was root installed on my new phone.

I never used the Facebook app  and now I can't view any of my private messages on my phone's browser.

Not having to install Messenger was the original reason installed it but then Messages became unavailable  with the app crashing every time to try to check them. It got to the point that it was crashing three or four times a day... so I replaced it. It was great for a long while but has been steadily declining for a long while  as well. Too bad.,#5,,,

There is an easy work around for that issue.. when loading messages the #useragent variable must report as a desktop version not a mobile browser and the messaging works just fine. I was looking for an app to bypass facebooks malicious scripting  along with its ability to launch the google play app when clicking the message icon. This app seems allow many malicious scripts  While firefox mobile allows me to change the #useragent variable and load messages,#5,,,

Hey guys  I love this app and everything it represents  although Facebook has recently tried to pull a fast one on you guys by updating their mobile browser messages platform. It causes tinfoil to crash whenever you go to the messages menu. And I figure it's because Facebook sends a pop up for their messages app everytime you hit the message button in a normal mobile browser. Hope you guys can fix this soon. :),no,,,
