7cc35f66-afc9-11e6-9747-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Scanner crashed Everytime I try to scan an ISBN # the app crashes. But if i enter the ISBN manually  its fine. I downloaded this app strictly for the scanner feature! Who has time to enter hundreds of numbers manually!?,1,scan IBSN
7cc36f61-afc9-11e6-8bc0-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Great app. Unlike the Goodreads app you can look at your library without any sort of internet  which is great. Not only that but you can import your Goodreads library. This app saved me from having to redo my entire library. Bit of a issue with the scanner crashing every once and awhile but other then that i have no complaints. Would definitely recommend this app to all book readers and collectors.,1,scan IBSN
7cc39761-afc9-11e6-9f62-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Needs an update Love that this app will sort by genre  however hate it is not shareable with my family. Another complaint is that every time I try to scan the barcode/ISBN  the app crashes so I'm having to put our books in manually to get them sorted by genre.,1,scan IBSN
7cc3c16b-afc9-11e6-aca8-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Just what I wanted I have been looking for an app just like this and now I've found it. I now have my entire library in my hand No more accidentally buying double copies  I can even Mark the ones I've already read. One of the few apps on my phone that works just how it should happen has never crashed on me  there are no ads And not once has it asked me for money.,no,
7cc3c99e-afc9-11e6-bbba-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,What a wonderfully designed app Content well organized and easy to use. I'v already scanned 350 books. I can think of nothing to improve this app. The only issue I've encountered is sometimes the app just closes down while I'm using it. When I reopen nothing is lost  so no big deal. I'm searching to see if this developer has an app for movies! Thank you for such a great app.,no,
