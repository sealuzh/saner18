db7410d4-afca-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,K9 is a very good email app! Unfortunately K9 crashes randomly on Android 6.01 (Moto g4 plus). At times the stored emails get corrupted.,no,

e7fc875c-afca-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Became buggy I've been using this for a long time. Now everytime I try to delete mail it freezes and crashes. Reported bug many times and not so much as a response from it.,no,delete
f6b04365-afca-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,I used to love the app. I still use it but the app crashes then emails don't load properly. After the update it's a huge disappointment,no,load
f772a90d-afca-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Used to be good Crashes every time I select more than a few emails for deletion. Also  hard to visually distinguish between read and unread. Uninstalling..,no,

0af10b98-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Stopped working :-( For some reason today this has just stopped working. I've cleared my cache  now tried uninstalling and reinstalling but get so far in the setting up process and each time the app just crashes  over and over. Today I missed a very important email because of this  and STILL can't get it to work. Very unhappy.,no,

2291efcd-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,K9 Mail 5 stars I prefer how reliable the k9 mail program is and rarely crashes.,no,
996a4851-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Frustrating enough to make you cry... Just kept having crash issues. Draughts were not completely saved resulting in frustration. The interface gets in the way of itself making it hard to star messages without scrolling down the page... The developers haven't responded at any point. But I could be the anomaly. I've since cleared data and removed all my accounts and started to put them back on one by one  but this is not favourable. It will also not let me export my account settings so I can't back my settings up if it goes t‰÷Éts-up again. RSVP,no,
d0e2924a-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,A LOT of fc's When did all the forced closes (crashes) start? This app has become really unstable.,no,
d41b9d45-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Problems sending email and numerous crashes I have used and loved this app for several years and thought it was the best email app our there. But on my new S7  I am having nothing but trouble. Constant problems when sending emails and crashes at least 4 times a day. I will be uninstalling and trying to find another app.,no,
d4e4b9a8-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Keeps stopping Used to be great  but now crashes (stops) several times each day on my new phone. Getting ready to uninstall if not resolved soon.,no,
f2e032c3-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Keeps crashing  Please fix  otherwise fine.,no,
f81c87de-afcb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Sorry  it now crashes and has become unusable.,no,
1b2f1bdf-afcc-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Used to be great.. then I had to switch because of wrong dates (and therefore sorting) on some messages  lack of swipes  a crash constantly occurring when receiving some type of messages (probably malformed but no other client I have tried crashed because of that)  and missing features in notifications.,no,pinch
6d0cbfce-afcc-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Love it!! Extremely easy  fast and accurate without crashing  and best of all is FREE!!!!,no,
cda85967-afcc-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crashes  Cannot Compact. Unfortunately it stops  regularly. Installed new update  tapped sync - CRASH. Have 4 accounts all POP/SMTP all empty but now one shows larger size after compacting. Pls fix.,no,

46583102-afcd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Nearly perfect Does what I want it to do but with the recent update it keeps crashing.,no,
4a95b3b3-afcd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Keeps crashing since last update What changed??? Ive been using for years and have liked  but K9 keeps crashing and is unusable for the past several days. I'm using a Nexus 5 with 6.0.1,no,
8e34cbd3-afcd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Used to be great. Needs updating. I have used K-9 for a number of years. It previously worked wonderfully. However  it now constantly freezes and crashes. Displaying a single email can regularly take 30 seconds. I would dearly love to see this wonderful app updated to resolve these problems. Running on Note 4  latest stock Verizon Android version.,no,
63aa2f6b-afce-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,The best POP/SMTP mail client  of those I've tried  available from Play Store. Four issues short of a 5-start rating: 1. The too-frequent 'crash and die' failures. 2. No indication of which account I'm dealing with when in any of the settings pages. Perhaps the account name beside the page title [Settings - nsaportal@gmail.con] would be a solution. 3. No spelling checker (please start with en-gb ;-). 4. The 'Unread messages' indicator shown on the widget selector  doesn't exist. However  these minor 'niggles' won't stop me using K-9 or send me out in search of a replacement. Big-ups to the developers; excellent work! Is this project still in development or are these issues never going to be addressed?,no,
130da10c-afcf-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Constantly crashes. And when it's not crashing... It's very slow.,no,
169f5358-afcf-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,NOT the best email app for android. In fact not even better than stock. So many times i've tried k9 mail now and came back disappointed every time. It crashes randomly  is impossible to set up with Exchange and does not even properly support Push! The app boasts to be best android email app but in fact is not even better than the stock android mail client. Quite the contrary! In stock client you just enter MS Exchange email address and password  done. Not so in k9! Maybe one day when k9 mail does not suck I'll give it 5 stars. Until then  1 star for repeatedly wasting my time.,no,
dbe6dd1f-afcf-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,"Best interface with unacceptable bug 80% of the time  deleting email's results in crash notification: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Unfortunately K-9 Mail has stopped."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" just too irritating to accept. Submitting crash reports have resulted in no feedback from K-9 let alone a problem fix. It's really a shame because it has my favorite look & features.

d6b827e4-afd0-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Used to be great but not good lately I have used this app for my email for years and it was really good until a few months ago. Since then the performance has been terrible and it crashed multiple times per day. Even doing something as simple as opening an email. This week it has stopped showing new emails. I get notifications that I have new email but when I open the app the newest message in my inbox is from 5 days ago. Please fix these issues or I will have to continue using another app.,no,open
7268437a-afd1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Terrible app This app crashes  at a minimum  daily. Sometimes it will crash several times per day. My favorite thing is when I get 500 notifications for the same email. Love that. Also  the nice 4 gig burn on my data from the turd running all night was a great surprise. Do yourself a favor and skip this app.,no,
74691c90-afd1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Just hate it Crashes with every try to login,no,login
f3c135c9-afd1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Have used for years now But it has been force closing constantly since the last update. Sometimes when i'm not even looking at the app. Not happy. Please fix this.,no,
7a61a0af-afd2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,My favourite email client when it comes to customizations  however the seemingly unsolved issues below makes me go for other alternatives : - great drain on battery of almost 60% which reduces battery life while the phone is idle - lots of heat generated from idle phone use - frequent app crashes,no,
8163c0aa-afd2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Grrr... Update 3... Now crashing almost every time I delete a message either from within the message or from the lost of messages. Update2... Fixed link clicks so they work. Good for most part but seriously annoying when on a daily basis it randomly turns off sync so messages stop being deleted on server. No reason why  just stops. Don't notice till you log in via web and see that hundreds of emails that you thought were deleted are all still sitting there. Waste of time,no,
11d76dcd-afd3-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Install crashes on Android 5 on Z3 Even remove of the old version did not help,no,

61c70805-afd4-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crash city Nexus 4  stock rom (latest) and crashes every time I multi select emails (e.g to bulk delete). Happens on Kaiten (fork) as well  so clearly a major issue with the build and not update for months has fixed it despite constantly sending crash logs. Giving up and moving to type mail.,no,
61f59217-afd4-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Installed. Tried to set up. Forced closed repeatedly. Uninstalled.,no,
62f093e9-afd4-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crashes Continually crashes.,no,
0feb1c42-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Reboot problem I've had the App for years and have been happy with it. Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3. After the update  my phone started crashing/rebooting about once a day. I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T  and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9  rebooted my phone  and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days. So  while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5  it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed.,no,
17cd640c-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crashes It crashes a bit too often everyday at least once or twice using galaxy s4,no,
d5334326-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Was fantastic  current version needs help... I've been using this mail client for years  and it was phenomenal. However about 2 or 3 updates ago  it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message  with the rest of the screen just a blank white space. More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem  but they haven't managed to kill it yet  making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes. Back to webmail for me  and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!,no,open
d8f86182-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Like the App in general Works well  but it does periodically crash  which is a little annoying. I don't seem to need to do anything as a result of the crashes  just click on it and it runs as if nothing happens. Other than that it works well.,no,
97ebe479-afd6-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crash crash crash WAS 5 stars. HTC one m8 stock. After update this app is broken. Crash when opening messages. Crash when sending email.,no,send
6244954e-afd7-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Great Yesterday the app started crashing on both my phones. I cleared the apps data and cache  but adding my imap account caused the app to crash again. I think k9 has a problem reading a few thousand mails? Maybe you can check this?,no,open

083aabd1-afdb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Update right now Yep. Fixed crashing after updating to 5.2 or something. Back to normal,no,
093119c4-afdb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,great email client need spam filtering but was the 1 of the only email clients I could find that allowed you to select all messages and delete them at once. Update: it's a year later and K9 still holds the crown for features  compatibility  and performance. Update: vicious bug with 5.1 Lollipop-selecting a message (or messages) crashes the app! The dog walkers fixed this within a few hours. Wow!,no,
0b46b359-afdb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,(Still) works for me :-) The latest version (5.003) is great. It's fast  doesn't crash  and works with Hotmail (you just have to know how - I found out from other helpful people.) Heartily (as opposed to hardly) recommended. :-),no,
0b63d84b-afdb-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,[FIXED - Thanks ] K9 great but has issues with Android v5.1 Due to its dark theming option K9 is my goto android email app. Unfortunitely on Android v5.1.0 K9 force closes anytime one or more emails are seleted from the left side list (check box). All other funtionality appear to work. This is true both on my Nexus 10 and 5 now that they run Android v5.1 while K9 did not have any issues with Android v5.0.2  hopefully this will be fixed soon.,no,
01f3a7f7-afdc-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Used to be good... Any time I try and add a new gmail account  it crashes right after checking incoming server settings. Tried reinstalling and now I can't even set up ONE account!,no,setting
49e70997-afdd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crashes Worked wonderfully for a long time  then I did an update and it started crashing. Uninstalled it thinking it might need a wipe (cache/dalvik/folder delete) but now it won't even run after install. Crashes on start. Shameful.,no,
512437b5-afdd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Last version upgrade is awful I used to love this app  now I hate it. With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders. It crashes and doesn't remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app. Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox  other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason. Very frustrating since it was much better.,no,
5b3a5a4d-afde-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Crashes Every Time on large messages Used to be good but it can't handle large emails any more. Will they ever fix it?,no,
6c2e4c19-afdf-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,From 5 to 3 Since the last few update  all it does is freeze up or crash. This was my go to email app for all my Android devices. Recommended to all family  friends and coworkers. Not anymore. Looking for a good replacement.,no,

067ae85c-d083-11e6-9556-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,5.201 is a non-starter: broken zoom  frequenct crashes I've reverted my install to 5.010. it isn't perfect but it works. In 5.201 zoom is broken and it crashed a few times in the few hours I've had it installed. Unacceptable  especially the broken zoom.,no,
0fac6c84-d083-11e6-9556-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Was great until recent update. Once I open mail it crashes out.,no,open
144e5657-d083-11e6-9556-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Has trouble with sorting and deleting Crashes trying to delete IMAP messages every time. Although It is the ONLY app I found capable of sorting messages and showing Internet headers  the reliability of some of these advanced function is only so-so for large numbers of messages (10k). Sorting by sender does not appear to work at all and sorting by date (sent) vs. received date only sort of worked. So overall a bit disappointing.,no,
506dfbc7-d215-11e6-a0f0-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Poor after update Was great till recent update that crashes its database. Some emails that can be opened previously now not able to.. now even manual fetching of email become so slow and sometimes hang... :-(,no,

5a5d51b6-d215-11e6-a0f0-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,New version crashes I've been using K-9 for years but you ruined it in this release! 1-everything is suddenly a lot slower. 2-app crashes while scrolling through messages in Sent folder. 3-App no longer goes straight to Inbox from phone's notification bar. Goes to folder list instead. 4-Why do you now have contacts pictures or initials on new messages and how do you turn this off? 5-Why the new drop down for cc: bcc: etc. It's too big. The old button was fine. I'll try to an downgrade older version for now or use something el,no,
5a93a3f8-d215-11e6-a0f0-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Crashing after last update Was working well until yesterday's update. Now it's just closing without any messages  when opening email. Not on all but on most emails! Pls return previous version!!!,no,

0c5fb17e-d604-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Latest update is hopeless. Now can't send emails from one of my accounts - UPDATE: fixed by recreating accounts  every folder had to be recreated. The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room. The app now crashes every so often  didn't happen before. Very disappointed.,no,
0f3a48c9-d604-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,PLEASE fix! The latest updates have ruined this once-great app! It crashes  force-closes  and when I reply to messages all the text that I am replying to is a dark blue and cannot be seen. I even downloaded earlier versions to install  but V5.0 which 'might' fix the problem fails to see my import back-up file. So until it's fixed  we're all just stuck. WHY update an app that was working?! I'm a long-time user  but will have to switch apps if this isn't fixed.,no,
10a87ed0-d604-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Great app. Have used it for some time. Unfortunately  started crashing every minute. So frustrating. Had to finally uninstall. Can't give higher rating until latest updates get fixed.,no,

334afc78-d795-11e6-8f17-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Latest version is bad. 5 stars prior to latest version - now 2 stars. The latest version introduced many bugs. You can no longer zoom text. Delete a message causes app to crash. Scroll to previous message causes crash. It seems to always end abruptly. There are probably more problems  but I don't want look for them.,no,pinch

It also sometimes loses messages in composition without saving a Draft. Switched to Blue Mail  which is missing some features important for POP3  but at least works.,no,
81f05a57-db83-11e6-8eeb-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Best android email app Thank you for such a terrific free app. The latest version has lots of cool features. May I suggest some features/fixes? A setting to allow attachment list to appear on top or below message body. Last update moved it to the bottom where they can be missed. Make confirm optional on 'mark all messages as read'. Searches on a large database makes screen go black for a few seconds and then crashes on longer search strings. 'Delete message' from home task list deletes message but dialog box can remain.,no,

8792d36c-dea7-11e6-ab42-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Used to be good  butnthe new version crashes constantly  even when I am using other apps. I had to uninstall it.,no,
93336820-e103-11e6-8fa8-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Since one of the latest updates it crashes quite often  but DEFINITELY DOES NOT LET ME TO DELETE OR MARK READ FROM NOTIFICATION. Samsung S7,no,

2484bde3-e47e-11e6-b02a-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Still crashing after most recent update. Wish you could move an email between email accounts.,no,
137518c6-e869-11e6-ba6b-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Still crashing frrquently after most recent update. Recently crashed while drafting email and I lost all the email I had typed. Wish you could move an email between email accounts. Long-time user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps. :(,no,compose
a922f7e6-e9a7-11e6-aa52-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,I've been using k9 for years and have loved it  but the last 3 or so updates have been horrible. Slowed the app down  and caused often crashes. I'm going to find an old version until this is resolved.,no,

afc852f0-ed95-11e6-8610-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Latest updates is causing the app to constantly crash on my Samsung. You can't compose an email as it will crash while you are doing so.,no,compose
79b1a2e8-f31b-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,I thought it was doing okay  but Keeps crashing. Reduced rating down from 4.5 to 2.5. :( I'm Not willing to send report because the Report button doesn't allow me to see what's being collected and for me to choose or approve. I greatly appreciate being able to export settings  & receipts  & many other features. Other than the need to fix crash problem  I can only suggest 3 things: 1. Allow messages to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date; like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones. 2. Allow to only download headers; again like default email app. 3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone. Especially when setup as an IMAP connection.,no,
7cdcf243-f31b-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,App crawls to a halt  crashes frequently. I suspect that the app can no longer handle large amounts of IMAP email. Please fix this!!!,no,
91aa6686-f4aa-11e6-8dd5-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,Really wanted to love it but last couple updates really screwed it up. HUGE lag when getting emails  date sorting is wrong  crashes when adding attachments to emails  sending errors.. all basic email functions that should just work. Sorry,no,attachment
12dae756-fb75-11e6-8508-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,This app used to be great but recently has gone down hill- crashes about twice a day  takes forever to process requests  eg to open a message. Also crashes when deleting messages.,no,delete
78d47443-1414-11e7-8f31-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,Came back to see if it would would work on my phone and it crashed! HTC ONE M9.,no,
823767a8-1414-11e7-8f31-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,Conceptually good and a decent design  but a totally unreliable piece of software. I'm not the most demanding app user  but I prefer programs to not CRASH every single time I use them - while I'm using them  especially something as crucial as a mail client..... Look elsewhere for your email needs!,no,
d465a3ce-15a4-11e7-9dbd-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,This app used to be good on the S7. However now constant sync disable messages show up and are you there have to force close the app or turn off the Wi-Fi and then turn it back on to refresh and get new emails but who wants to keep doing that all day. Also blinking light notification no longer works unless you use sound or vibrate. Due to all of these issues with the application that I can no longer recommend it to anyone until they get fix it,no,
4841add3-2302-11e7-8e68-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,Update: it became so bad after updates  very slow downloading new mails  crashes when deleting mails  reply rarely works. Now uninstalled and using a different app.,no,

aa6f942a-6879-11e7-ad17-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,Latest update is hopeless. Now can't send emails from one of my accounts - UPDATE: fixed by recreating accounts  every folder had to be recreated. The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room. The app now crashes every so often  didn't happen before. Very disappointed. 7/17 - all of a sudden it can't connect to my Yahoo account  authentication failed. What's going on? Started working again without any changes from me. Rating back up to 4.,no,
aebf1834-6879-11e7-ad17-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,July 2017 update: Still crashing frrquently. I have sent dozens of crash reports. Most often crashes when reading email and rotating my phone from portrait to landscape. With certain emails  problem is repeatable every time. Wish you could move an email between email accounts. Long-time user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps. :(,no,open
56b13bc6-7897-11e7-94d3-000c29dba5da,com.fsck.k9,It just works. I've been using K9 for over a year with three email accounts. It's never crashed  and it's always worked. I like it better than my laptop email program.,no,
