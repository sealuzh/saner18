78c32789-df4d-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,com.evancharlton.mileage,Good app  suggestions for import improvements Pretty good. Import crashes if there are missing fields App is set to enter volume and total price  import with volume and price but no price per unit  will end up showing $1.00 in price per unit.
