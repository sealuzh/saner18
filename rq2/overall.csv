The 'Unread messages' indicator shown on the widget selector  doesn't exist. However  these minor 'niggles' won't stop me using K-9 or send me out in search of a replacement.

0feb1c42-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Reboot problem I've had the App for years and have been happy with it. Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3. After the update  my phone started crashing/rebooting about once a day. I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T  and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9  rebooted my phone  and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days. So  while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5  it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed.,no,

However about 2 or 3 updates ago  it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message  with the rest of the screen just a blank white space. More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem  but they haven't managed to kill it yet  making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes. Back to webmail for me  and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!,no,open
d8f86182-afd5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.fsck.k9,Like the App in general Works well  but it does periodically crash  which is a little annoying. I don't seem to need to do anything as a result of the crashes  just click on it and it runs as if nothing happens. Other than that it works well.,no,

Update: it's a year later and K9 still holds the crown for features  compatibility  and performance. Update: vicious bug with 5.1 Lollipop-selecting a message (or messages) crashes the app! The dog walkers fixed this within a few hours. Wow!,no,

All other funtionality appear to work. This is true both on my Nexus 10 and 5 now that they run Android v5.1 while K9 did not have any issues with Android v5.0.2  hopefully this will be fixed soon.,no,

With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders. It crashes and doesn't remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app. Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox  other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason. Very frustrating since it was much better.,no,

144e5657-d083-11e6-9556-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Has trouble with sorting and deleting Crashes trying to delete IMAP messages every time. Although It is the ONLY app I found capable of sorting messages and showing Internet headers  the reliability of some of these advanced function is only so-so for large numbers of messages (10k). Sorting by sender does not appear to work at all and sorting by date (sent) vs. received date only sort of worked. So overall a bit disappointing.,no,

Goes to folder list instead. 4-Why do you now have contacts pictures or initials on new messages and how do you turn this off? 5-Why the new drop down for cc: bcc: etc. It's too big. The old button was fine. I'll try to an downgrade older version for now or use something el,no,

The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room. The app now crashes every so often  didn't happen before. Very disappointed.,no,
0f3a48c9-d604-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,PLEASE fix! The latest updates have ruined this once-great app! It crashes  force-closes  and when I reply to messages all the text that I am replying to is a dark blue and cannot be seen. I even downloaded earlier versions to install  but V5.0 which 'might' fix the problem fails to see my import back-up file. So until it's fixed  we're all just stuck. WHY update an app that was working?! I'm a long-time user  but will have to switch apps if this isn't fixed.,no,
10a87ed0-d604-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.fsck.k9,Great app. Have used it for some time. Unfortunately  started crashing every minute. So frustrating. Had to finally uninstall. Can't give higher rating until latest updates get fixed.,no,

It also sometimes loses messages in composition without saving a Draft. Switched to Blue Mail  which is missing some features important for POP3  but at least works.,no,

Reduced rating down from 4.5 to 2.5. :( I'm Not willing to send report because the Report button doesn't allow me to see what's being collected and for me to choose or approve. I greatly appreciate being able to export settings  & receipts  & many other features. Other than the need to fix crash problem  I can only suggest 3 things: 1. Allow messages to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date; like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones. 2. Allow to only download headers; again like default email app. 3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone. Especially when setup as an IMAP connection.,no,

It's all in one  the way it should be. Theres a couple little things that I'd gripe about but its nothing compared to how the official app is  lol.
