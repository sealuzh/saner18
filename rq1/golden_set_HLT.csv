7cdfd33a-afc9-11e6-8eaa-c4b301cdf627,com.ringdroid,What happened to this app? Used to work great  loved it... but now everytime I hit the search the app closes... and when I have to scroll to find a song ( because I can't use the search or it closes ) the song doesn't download fully. Maybe I'll just uninstall it and reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem. If not I guess I'm just going to get rid of it. Ok...looks like that fixed the problem...the app is back to being awesome again,August 07 2016,5,1,1

Deal breaker right there. Also  the settings are buggy. Pressing the android back button doesn't work  you can't test the double tap to close feature in the preview  and some settings don't reflect the actual setting you've chosen (my clock says it's analog even though I've picked digital).

The UI isn't great (it shows filenames  not metadata; added songs are invisibly queued until you press add  and cancel is arguably too close; removing and reordering tends to seek back to the top of the list view; etc.) but the fact that it allows one to construct an ordered playlist  can source music from any readable location in the filesystem  allows one to quickly append tracks from a single directory in a specific order  and has an easy to use text-file playlist format more than makes up for those deficiencies.

The app is just amazing generally  it just has a couple of quirks that happen sometimes that don't exactly ruin its functionality  but they are slightly annoying. For example  when the screen goes to sleep and I turn it on again  or if I exit the app and open it again  it will have reset to the first playlist instead of the one I'm on.

You don't always open apps from the Launcher (i.e. Notification Bar  Pie Control  etc) and so the History doesn't get populated. If History shows the apps that were present in Recents as well  it can actually replace Recents altogether. 2) Ability to Pin items in History so they will never scroll up  making it the bottom-most app. Also  ability to rearrange pinned items. 3) Swipe horizontally to remove items from history (except pinned items if they get implemented).,March 21 2016,4,1,

1c965590-afe3-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,fr.unix_experience.owncloud_sms,I don't get this at all Well  I thought this app will let me sync SMS messages among multiple phones  and also let me see them on my ownCloud interface. Sure it did some uploading. I can't disable the sync notification  which would only be of interest in case of a problem. However  the OC interface brought my server to a crawl. It was really slow to show some message threads  some of them with names  some with only numbers. And it took literally minutes to switch among them when I clicked on them. Also  it only shows the last (?) message of each thread  and the number of messages. Even that with wrong date. And it didn't accomplish why I purchased and installed it in the first place: didn't sync messages among devices. Which  while the description only states to sync to the server  would be quite logical  considering the whole point of ownCloud is to keep stuff in sync among multiple devices/computers. So in the end  I'd ask for a refund if I could. At least until it's fixed to an usable level.,November 13 2014,2,1,

7be97f94-afc9-11e6-a0e7-c4b301cdf627,me.sheimi.sgit,Competent GIT client. This is a competent Git client  and comes with an editor for making changes to a repository. I tend to use it more for monitoring a repo than working on one  in which role it excels. Diffs are colourful  and it uses Gravatar. Of course  since it syncs the file to local storage  this is a handy offline Git client  useful with services like Github or Bitbucket when you know in advance that their native app won't be able to connect. There are a couple of minor irritations. Dates are always displayed in the US format  despite my system-wide preference for UK format. Additionally  while syntax highlighting is available in the file viewer  you must explicitly select the language every time you open a file for viewing. It doesn't use the file extension  and it doesn't remember previous choices. Secure shell works well  but you'd have to bear in mind that if you're a key user  it can't use password protected keys (as I write).

7bd2a582-afc9-11e6-aca7-c4b301cdf627,net.syntaxblitz.plucklock,Works flawlessly for what it's meant to do Plucklock is extremely simple to use and set up  as a start. You simply decide how sensitive you want the application to be and it does the rest. It's useful both to protect your phone from potential pluckers and as an alternative method of locking your phone. Careful  though  of low sensitivity thresholds as they may prove more of a hindrance than anything else. At a threshold of around 2.5 I found that the phone wouldn't go off randomly or inconveniently  but would do so with a quick shake.,December 01 2014,5,1,

7c7ab682-afc9-11e6-8316-c4b301cdf627,be.digitalia.fosdem,Fantastic app! This app is very easy to use; better than many conference apps I've tried. The notifications for upcoming sessions I've starred can be turned off or changed in the settings  and I appreciated the links to a map of the session location for each session so I can find my way there quickly. The only improvement I can think of is to make it easier to find the next sessions as the conference goes on; right now when I go to the list of sessions I starred  or a list of all the sessions in a specific track  it lists them chronologically and as the conference goes on  I have to check the current time and scroll to the appropriate place in the list. I would love it if it jumped past or greyed out the sessions that are over so that I can more easily identify current & future sessions. Thank you Christophe!,February 04 2014,5,2,

Pinning the app and changing the order with 'Pinned app sorting' option is all good and stuff  however it would be much more easier to have a drag & drop option.

7be2a933-afc9-11e6-9b4c-c4b301cdf627,com.blogspot.tonyatkins.freespeech,Amazing app This app is perfect for someone who struggles with aphasia but is still able to read. I love the customization options  and the ability for each word pressed to take you to a page with the most likely next word is extremely helpful. Also  my thanks to the dev for implementing a consistent back/home button when adding new tabs! I do have one request  it's the only reason I keep a 2nd AAC app installed in addition to this one: I use a bluetooth keyboard to navigate my tablet - I'm sure I'm not the only one. This app is great for expressing frequently-said words and phrases  but as it's impossible to predict everything I want to say (and time consuming to touch each word of a sentence individually)  sometimes I prefer typing with my keyboard. I know this app allows for that if you press the menu button and enter a special screen  but that separates it from the other features and being able to simply press a button immediately for a quick reply or pre-buttoned word/phrase. The other app I sometimes use remedies this by having an entry line at the top of the main screen itself. If this app could do something similar  that would be great. Still  terrific app!,March 23 2015,5,2,

Instead  I simply started using Chrome for my mobile FB access. Recently  I discovered this app. It doesn't offer too much over what a bookmark link would do  but I like that Facebook access is sandboxed  and that the page view is full screen without that URL bar that is visible in a regular browser. It would be wonderful if there was a way to integrate picture sharing to Facebook via the ACTION_SEND intent  but I'm not sure if it's possible to implement with Facebook's mobile website.

7cd282eb-afc9-11e6-9c17-c4b301cdf627,com.gelakinetic.mtgfam,All you need A great  stable app. I use it almost exclusively. My only issue is the app draws from only one price list. (Tcg player) It would be nice to also see starcity or Canadian prices (face to face games),October 13 2014,4,2,

7cd0b14a-afc9-11e6-853e-c4b301cdf627,com.gelakinetic.mtgfam,Great and all... But now that those bugs have been fixed  I just wish there was a decklist feature that showed u basically a checklist of an entire deck and the prices of all cards individually and a total at top similar to the trade option but is easier to handle the individual card quantities for quick edits and to see how much the deck costs in total as well as a filter for things like price high to low and alphabetical order.

7cd034cc-afc9-11e6-a479-c4b301cdf627,com.gelakinetic.mtgfam,Great app  but...

7bdc4c68-afc9-11e6-a46d-c4b301cdf627,com.harleensahni.android.mbr,Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.,November 30 2014,4,2,

7cdebf07-afc9-11e6-b33c-c4b301cdf627,com.ichi2.anki,Great - needs progressive answer reveal Helps in memorizing facts. please add progressive revelation of answer. For example  the first anatomy picture above had 3 facts on 3 separate lines. instead of just one 'Show Answer' button  have two buttons - 'Show next line' and 'Show all answer' or words to similar effect. This could be an option in settings for just having one button or the progressive two buttons. This would help in memorizing long answers - eg long verses  a longer lists than the above etc. I used lots of line breaks to make only the first line of the answer show. Scrolling line per line as I recite allows me to check for perfect recall per line before continuing. However with Anki updates  Anki now forces the display of most or all of the answer on hitting 'Show Answer'. All the cards have to be changed again to control the flow of answer being revealed. Too much at once and its difficult to check if I recited perfectly or not. It's just like an anatomy picture with 20 items. Answer 1  check  anwer 2 check -etc The hint would take lots of time to make each card. Show one line at a time would make cards easier to produce = more study time.,September 08 2014,4,2,

So I tried saying I got all them wrong so I could review then whenever I wanted. After you get more than one wrong it will just constantly go back to the words you got wrong; preventing you from practicing other. It also goes in the order that they were added.

I tried several different apps before landing on this one and it is the only one as versatile as my old plastic counter. I have only one item for which I would suggest a change and it is minor.

This one incorporates all of those features and does it without ads.

It took a few tries changing the settings to get the best results and good battery life. A new feature I would suggest is having the ability to save settings profiles. For example so I could save settings that would log slower for when I hike verse logging faster for when I am cycling or in a car.

I recommended this app to everyone who does part-singing. The option to show lyrics and measure numbers already present is a plus. My community chorus midis are notated that way.

I guess i loved the old design much more  seeing how it looked more refined as compared to the original PD  and it gave SPD an identity I fell in love with. The search button is annoying as I prefer to have 2 separate search buttons like before. I know that might interfere with the 4 items slot  so why not group the 4 quick slots in a square for convenience? One handed function would be improved by this too. Lastly the wand auto targeting sucks. I can't do my long shots that hit corners anymore :(,August 19 2015,4,2,

Also i now only get the amulet and deafeat the end boss and go to level 1  but then it finished:-( could you add in a castle or something above the dungeon and give the amulet to the king or something.

561e27ec-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Best game for Android Best game for Android  very difficult  very rewarding. After beating it 4(5) times I can say that random traps need to be removed  as a rng chance you take heavy damage by walking is just retarded. Maybe hide the traps in the trap rooms. Also more variety and difference between the different rooms and enemy's would be great. Thanks devs,July 17 2016,5,2,

I know that there is a separate main menu button but if i want to exit the game I'll just hit the home button. Please remove the button!",August 03 2016,4,2,

5951f3d1-aff5-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Was great fun Still my favourite game - by far  but the degrading mechanic killed it alot I think. I'm not taking a star away cuz pixel Dungeon is still pixel Dungeon but I would REALLY like to see degradation go away.,December 04 2015,5,2,

7c915f4a-afc9-11e6-acdf-c4b301cdf627,com.zegoggles.smssync,Love it I love this application  makes it easy to backup and restore SMS  I would love an interface overhaul  however  you never really look at it  just once for backup set up and then when restoring,October 30 2016,5,2,
7c935c4f-afc9-11e6-83e0-c4b301cdf627,com.zegoggles.smssync,Sort of works ok but restored SMS conversations have been divided into two threads per contact; one thread for messages sent and another for received. Looks messy and it's impossible to follow old conversations. Exactly the same issue as a rival app!,December 17 2015,3,2,

7cce8d17-afc9-11e6-8abb-c4b301cdf627,cx.ring,Just a suggestion ! Devs you can add cloud storage support (Google Drive etc) to automatically export/import accounts. So that on every first startup applications asks for user like what kind of storage they r using to store accounts. Then list all avail accounts from that location  so tgat user can choose which account to import. And at creation of every account prompt(optional) them to save their account.,August 30 2016,5,2,

7c75880f-afc9-11e6-8113-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,"Clear  simple  mostly intuitive I really like the simplicity. Popular apps like Podcast Addict and Podcast Republic display often useless information  like """"""""last time podcast was checked for updates"""""""". All podcast apps always check for updates when you run them  so that's just clutter. It feel like I have to go 5 menus deep to do basic tasks with the others  and 3 menus is a """"""""bad"""""""" as it gets with antenna pod. The one place I would offer criticism however: searching for podcast should be default  with an option to use the other methods.",June 03 2014,5,2,
7c7259d7-afc9-11e6-8da5-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Can't Disable Lock-Screen Skip Button Overall  it's kind of a cumbersome app  but does well enough. A huge problem for me the inability  despite changing the settings  to disable the 'skip' button. I've lost my place in countless podcasts when my phone gets triggered in my pocket and the button--that I CANNOT remove--gets bumped.,October 28 2016,1,2,
7c75a119-afc9-11e6-b32d-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Solid Doesn't have all the features of other podcast managers but does what it does very well. Love  that you can sort the queue list. Moving to this as Pocket Casts is increasingly full of features I don't use.,March 19 2014,4,2,
7c75242e-afc9-11e6-b6a7-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Best gpodder-integrated app I've tried Everything works wonderfully. Only thing I'd really like to see in future updates is full player controls on the widget and lock screen components. I often skip back a few seconds to re-listen to things I might've missed  but I have to unlock my phone and open the full app to do that right now. Relatively minor  but it'd be a useful feature.,August 29 2015,4,2,
7c73a78c-afc9-11e6-b579-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Has what I need and ad free! Thank God. A lil refinement needed  I looked far and wide for an ad free podcast app  and this meets that requirement and so many more! You can search and add podcasts from iTunes directly. Only thing I wish was different is to be able to delete downloaded podcasts directly from the episode interfaces,May 28 2016,5,2,
7c759a2e-afc9-11e6-b764-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Decent But Flawed This application is extremely basic - which is not necessarily a 'bad' thing. It just doesn't seem to perform those basics well  e.g. when I have paused a podcast and returned at a later time...I don't currently see a way to start it again. There is no 'play' button  and the only available option is 'skip.' It also won't let me delete a podcast in mid-play unless I 'skip' it.,April 13 2014,3,2,
7c75b5e1-afc9-11e6-bdef-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Incredible free option For a genuinely ad free app  its a great choice. A couple if detailed features such as lock screen next/previous and 15 forward/backward do not exist yet. Solid performance and ease of use.,January 06 2014,4,2,
7c73f891-afc9-11e6-b367-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Great app Would be 5 star if the skip 30 second button was on the lock screen. Overall does exactly what I need,April 03 2016,4,2,
7c7580a3-afc9-11e6-96ad-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Works well This app works really well. My only wish is that it would flag the podcasts I've listened to so I can hide them from view.,June 16 2014,4,2,
7c96b754-afc9-11e6-aa4c-c4b301cdf627,de.j4velin.pedometer,Nice Keep the good work going! What I'd like to see in the app as well : - visualization of my steps during the day  to see when I was active and when not - push up notification when I have not enough steps in the evening or when I'm not moving for a few hours - better statistics in general,January 27 2014,5,2,
7c969eb0-afc9-11e6-934e-c4b301cdf627,de.j4velin.pedometer,Great Nexus 5 app. This is a great app better than any of the others out there  has some minor bugs. Please can you look into saving the days data in a way that it is not lost when the phone or app crashes so that history is not lost? Would be really nice if I cold scroll left and see my last month of daily activity  without having to register my personal details.,February 19 2014,5,2,
7c960d0f-afc9-11e6-b387-c4b301cdf627,de.j4velin.pedometer,Lot to improve. Need to be more accurate. Better history view. Etc,April 19 2015,2,2,
7c0da0b0-afc9-11e6-afa0-c4b301cdf627,de.j4velin.wifiAutoOff,"Usefull and simple but could be more Could have more option combinations. ex: """"""""not connected to any network for 5min"""""""" AND """"""""screen off for 1min"""""""". so downloads wont stop with the screen off when we need to download something",October 21 2014,5,2,
7cbde97a-afc9-11e6-8296-c4b301cdf627,de.koelle.christian.trickytripper,Very good app If you could add a description field for transfer transaction same as the one for the payment to make some notes for what you transfer the money for the other person. Thanks and hope to see it soon,March 10 2015,5,2,
7c91034c-afc9-11e6-b321-c4b301cdf627,de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor,Awesome Now  if it would lend you a bit more tools like the ability of adding textures to read or write into  or use the home screen on rooted devices for creating cool animations; or maybe even have options to write geometry or vertex shaders. Anyway  one can only dream  overall it is a great app and I thank you for it. A certain elegance and a fine sense for details can definitely be seen from the start. One last thing thou  can there be an option to use Tab as a character and not a navigational key for those with physical keyboards? It is totally annoying  but there might be something I miss to see.,February 18 2015,4,2,
7c6297f0-afc9-11e6-ad9d-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,Awesome..but It is an awesome app.. would be great if i could see on my PC what I am typing .. instead of having to look at the phone..,January 17 2015,4,2,
7c11c802-afc9-11e6-a1b9-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.sensorreadout,Good but needs an option to change colors. I cant see the tiny red line on the black background. Lines need to be thicker and more defined so they can be seen. And wherr is the HRM sensor from the Samsung Phones?,August 30 2015,3,2,
7c9a4ca3-afc9-11e6-9d1d-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Good Interface  Minimal Features What it does  it does well. One thing I don't like is the file management. I have my library organized by author  series  and then the books. I can't select a root folder to add (my master Audio Book folder)  otherwise it thinks the sub-folders are their own book. My suggestion: having it maybe show the sub-folders  and then clicking the folders shows the next folders  kind of like a music management  where you click on artist  then album and such.,April 10 2016,4,2,
7c99f9dc-afc9-11e6-8eb9-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Okay Very plain. Lacking in features. Wish it could actually hide folders and does what it says it can.,October 28 2016,3,2,
7c9a958a-afc9-11e6-81d4-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Brilliant looking app but adding sleep at end of chapter would make it a much better app for me. Also an option to not display the name of the audiobook as many have it in the cover photo. A more compact display would make it easier to browse as well.,December 09 2015,4,2,
7c9a3ac0-afc9-11e6-aeca-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Great but.... I would really like to be able to set a sleep timer on the fly without going into settings and changing it permanently. Maybe hold and drag to adjust?,May 26 2016,4,2,
7c9adc14-afc9-11e6-8094-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Good app So far I like this quite well I only wish it had a sleep timer count down visible on screen.,June 23 2015,4,2,
7c9adb91-afc9-11e6-b6cc-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Extra basic  extra good This is pretty much everything you want in an audio book player. It's a smidge more basic than I might like (only one sleep time  loading of folders one by one) but these are small ux quibbles. The only major missing feature is chapter support on .MPa files  but I imagine this would be highly complex and thus be against the simplicity design philosophy.,June 23 2015,4,2,
4d3f6d11-af52-11e6-8c10-b603b9227580,de.qspool.clementineremote,Made me switch to clementine This is a brilliant app to control clementine. All it needs is a few tweaks and additional options: playlist mangement is unintuitive and buggy. A sleep timer and stop after current song would be quite welcome. EDIT: longpressing pauze achieves toggling stop after current track.,November 28 2015,4,2,
7cb051d1-afc9-11e6-bd33-c4b301cdf627,de.saschahlusiak.freebloks,Good fun Wish the corners of potential play would be darker. Can't see them half the time.,March 06 2016,3,2,
7c7acd2b-afc9-11e6-b36c-c4b301cdf627,de.smasi.tickmate,Absolutely fantastic Nice  simple  interface to tick off whether you're adhering to your goals. No unnecessary permissions is an additional bonus. The only grouch is  and I feel I am not being very gracious here  that there is no option to transpose the goals into rows and the days into columns. The tick-off buttons get a wee bit narrow if one is tracking more than  say  six goals. Five stars  nevertheless.,May 12 2014,5,2,
7c250eba-afc9-11e6-9dc0-c4b301cdf627,dev.ukanth.ufirewall,Great work Nice app. But can not block sub connections of particular app.we should able to block only Add connections of the app. If you can do this small change then I'll give 5 stars :-),May 22 2014,4,2,

Colors don't have a separate unnecessary menu  and the reminder date moves to the time  just as it should. Excellent work!

When I leave home and lose my wifi connection  the notification is that mobile data is now enabled I would love to see a desc of when not if is triggered. I just enabled preference to show alt icon when wifi is lost and several times it has changed to that icon and notified me wifi is lost even though it is not.

The reason it's 4 instead of 5 is that it wasn't recording while it was waiting for an answer to the APlease Rate This App prompt.

Many times  when I skip to the next track on the playlist  there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before  so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year  but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub  but after reinstalling  i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker  everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks.,April 09 2015,4,2,

Really want the opposite of the blur feature to be implemented though - lock screen should be blurred and the home screen should be clear.,April 27 2016,4,2,
7cac378c-afc9-11e6-8312-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Center the image Please allow us to choose whether we want the wallpaper to be swipeable or just leave it there and crop it or select where to be the center of the pan. Please! Been waiting for 3 years to see if you figured that out,April 26 2016,1,2,
7caf80a6-afc9-11e6-885e-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Nice but There should be additional option so as to control the double tap blur effect. Either of the all time no-blur else a specific time interval for blur adjust!,November 26 2014,4,2,
7cafcf5c-afc9-11e6-84fb-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Great App I really like how it keeps my wallpapers fresh. However  the parallax effect is waaay too strong. I have two pages on my home screen and it skips right over the content of the image most times. If there was a slider for modifying the amount the image moves on scrolling between pages that would be swell.,October 22 2014,4,2,
7cac56f5-afc9-11e6-97fe-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Love it. 1 suggestion! This is my go-to wallpaper app. I am wondering if the dev could add a setting to decide if the wallpaper chosen can be shown in full rather than the zoom currently. Its not easy to explain  but the photos coming in from Reddit are high resolution and muzei shows pixels at 1:1 with phone resolution. Would like option to zoom out or show the whole image? Hopefully you know what I mean.,March 24 2016,5,2,
7cad22ca-afc9-11e6-8a5a-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Great platform Gives me a refreshing wallpaper everyday from a nice collection of galleries. My only complaint is that it's quite rare for a wallpaper to look good while blurred. Wallpapers with light colors are fine but the darker one which I prefer aren't. It's not all that problematic though since I can simply turn it off.,September 05 2015,4,2,

The user interface can be obscure (like after a long tap on a location  how to make that go away?)  but mostly quite nice. For a map while driving  showing where I am  not as pretty as Google Maps  but more functional. Swipe down: Didn't think of that. I tapped elsewhere  could you make that do it  too?,May 10 2016,5,2,

7c164f6b-afc9-11e6-8d92-c4b301cdf627,net.osmand.plus,Potentially excellent but right now pretty poor. For example  when displaying cycle routes it's impossible to see if the transparent red route on a yellow road is the route  or if it's an orange road. Yes  you can tell if you look really closely  but that isn't possible while riding. Instructions are not only minimal but incomprehensible as they refer to menus and settings that don't come with the download. I should have tried the free version first.,July 18 2015,2,2,

7c164940-afc9-11e6-9aa7-c4b301cdf627,net.osmand.plus,Good maps  but after years still rather poor search Server backed search on Google maps may have spoilt us  but the inability to perform a fuzzy search at least to a place without going through the rigmarole of selecting an arbitrary exact address from a hierarchy just isn't good enough. Also not being able to download tiles without searching through a text based list is poor. You have to know the name of the region of interest and how it is organised under OSM  for example that Great Britain has its own listing outside of Europe. Could be so much more...,July 28 2015,2,2,

7c170875-afc9-11e6-92ae-c4b301cdf627,net.osmand.plus,great maps but confusing on European roads. Without showing the motorway road signs it can be very tricky to follow directions at exits or roundabouts. I love the maps but im forced to use an app with much clearer 3d navigation and exit road signs. So when that feature is added this will get 5 stars.,July 21 2014,3,2,

I'd certainly pay for it. This is the best free white noise app I've tried. I love how I can customize the frequency and create whatever sound I want. Please also consider adding an explanation of sound frequencies (definitions of white noise  pink noise brown noise  etc) as well as a numerical scale on the color graph.

I wish that the in-app settings had an option to turn off the breaking-news notifications. Also  this app tends to require many taps just to get to what you want (eg. 4 taps to listen live your local station; 5 taps to listen to a Car Talk episode). So I just started to use. NPR One for podcasts (simpler than this app) but I still need this app for listen live. Not crazy about needing 2 separate apps just for NPR.,September 26 2016,3,2,

To me 2-3 seconds is usually enough  anything more is a waste of power. I constantly have to switch analysis on/off which is annoying esp. that it also removes the arrows and the engine output. An analysis time limit setting and a button at the bottom telling the engine to continue (if the user wants more depth in some positions) would solve this.

I even got the premium key. However  it is not allowing transfer between accounts in different currencies  which is a deal breaker for me as it makes the app next to useless on trips abroad  which is one of the main reasons to carry an app like this around.

Even with 133% hit chance I feel like I miss a third of the time. Also  put more details in our quest lot so we aren't having to take our own notes to keep up with the 10ish quest we have going on at the same time.

Today I am happy to report that AnkiDroid does exactly what I wanted. Adding cards is easy; the review interface is streamlined and practical to use with one thumb; and it does a good job of showing the cards I am struggling with. Synchronization between AnkiDroid (on a phone and a tablet)  the desktop app  and the web site all works smoothly. The navigation in the AnkiDroid UI confused me somewhat when I first starting using it. For example  the back button moves up to a higher level in the app structure  rather than returning you to the previous screen  which is fine but unexpected.

It's easy enough to root your device but then stumbling across this app without knowing what you're doing could easily destroy a device if someone doesn't use it correctly  especially if used on a tablet without a changeable/removable battery and you end up ruining your battery beyond repair by calibration etc. So a glossary of terms section in the settings  or even better an ? Icon next to each function explaining what it will affect if used would be ideal. I know a lot about these types of functions but some to me are even a little confusing and so need to be googled.

17f78d4f-af51-11e6-8c10-b603b9227580,me.ccrama.redditslide,I know it's a beta version  but there's still a lot of work to do. For starters  the comments section is a bit confusing (it's messy because it lacks visual hierarchy)  and it could use some reworking: there should be a better distinction between a comment's header (the part where the commenter's username and flair  and the comment's score are displayed) and the comment's body; Roboto Light should be available for the comments section as well. I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level. On the subreddit view  there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on  so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized  and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know  beforehand  what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is it an image? Gif? Video? Lastly  search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar)  because it's something people do a lot. Also  it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again.

7c171d8f-afc9-11e6-a7a1-c4b301cdf627,net.osmand.plus,Soso The idea of a opensource version of a navigation is great  but i found it confusing to use. There is for one the city specification which may not OsmAnd's issue at all. In my area streets were defined to a totally different city. Also searches are resulting in different choice but don't indicate what house number are hidden behind the results making it a lucky guess to where to drive and arrive. I tried several navigation apps and it is a pretty good feature pack  but i think its needs more work to make it more accessible. This is my verdict so far. I still haven't figured out what buildings supposed to be in the search. Mm... I give it 3 stars because its guided me wrongly for features it deserves more.,June 06 2014,3,3,

Edit: I downloaded and tried to work with it for a couple months again  because I really want it to work. But it doesn't. Search is horrible.

It's easy enough to root your device but then stumbling across this app without knowing what you're doing could easily destroy a device if someone doesn't use it correctly  especially if used on a tablet without a changeable/removable battery and you end up ruining your battery beyond repair by calibration etc. So a glossary of terms section in the settings  or even better an ? Icon next to each function explaining what it will affect if used would be ideal. I know a lot about these types of functions but some to me are even a little confusing and so need to be googled.

17f78d4f-af51-11e6-8c10-b603b9227580,me.ccrama.redditslide,I know it's a beta version  but there's still a lot of work to do. For starters  the comments section is a bit confusing (it's messy because it lacks visual hierarchy)  and it could use some reworking: there should be a better distinction between a comment's header (the part where the commenter's username and flair  and the comment's score are displayed) and the comment's body; Roboto Light should be available for the comments section as well. I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level. On the subreddit view  there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on  so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized  and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know  beforehand  what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is it an image? Gif? Video? Lastly  search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar)  because it's something people do a lot. Also  it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again. Despite all this  Slide is the best Reddit app in the Play Store right now; it just needs a couple of improvements to be the perfect one.,February 04 2016,3,3,

(I tried a lot of android apps  all of which were confusing and way to complicated not to mention they didn't work with my device). I was super excited when I came across this app and read all the positive reviews and even more excited to see the instructions from Jim Roal - Thank you Jim. Finally  I was able to follow the instructions with no problems (thanks to the added link Jim provided with his review).

Without this I think this app is not suitable for research; I organise all my working papers on Zotero and use a webdav cloud to sync everything. I would love a papership type app in my device  that would let me access and read the files. Android is behind ios in terms of research tools. Zandy is going in the right direction  but is not quite there yet (look at papership for good ideas!). Hope this is changed soon  I am willing to reconsider my review if this changes.

Two issues  not necessarily for the app itself  which in my case works quite smoothly without crashes: - I had trouble locating the Esc key on the keyboard  such a very important key in vim  but this is a problem of the keyboard itself. I have to use a silly combination of function and control keys to get it. - Now that I have edited and saved a file  how do I send it and use it elsewhere??? I would appreciate an upload or send feature  as in the Photo Gallery. Now I have to hunt down the files with a file manager or do it with a console. This should be easier!,September 22 2014,4,4,

Yes  we all know that green is the color of healing  but actually it stimulates the reproduction of all possible cells which bind our organism. That means the bad tumorous cells as well  in case we have cancer. That's why it is not a good color choice for that group of people. And who uses morphine more often than them?

Also if you have an Ankh  why do you lose all your bags & equipment upon dying? Ankh should auto-rez you like the Dew Vial filling upon reaching 0 Health or let you pick up your old equip from your corpse since its still the same run.

7cdb9b1e-afc9-11e6-9464-c4b301cdf627,com.ichi2.anki,Orig 2/13/2016: Was a nice little application to practice words while waiting in line at the store. That was until all my decks just disappeared. Now  why would I want to use the application without anything to practice?! Update 2/14/2016 I thought that this was caused by a automatic update to a version that forced a logging into the site to use any features. Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site  and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive  I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again. Next  I restored the last copy of the folder before the card sets disappeared. Then started the application and the cards all showed-up again. I'm happy that I had the backup and that it was that simple.,May 03 2016,5,4,

I have one question: Why do I have a pin and a star on my notification bar when I have a reminder set? I would love to just have the pin. (That is personal preference and doesn't detract from a lovely app.) [EDIT: Okay  I see that the 'pin' icon is shown when you want the shortcut for a new pin in the pulldown menu and the 'star' is to tell you there is a outstanding notification. I don't think you need them both - the shortcut doesn't need an icon because you know it's there and then you could then use the 'pin' icon as the primary reminder  rather than the star - which is less intuitive.] I hope you don't mind the suggestions.,September 15 2015,5,4,

I didn't know if keys are stored also in their servers or only in my device. But with this application because of free software nature you have source codes so you are able to audit code if you want. Also in previous I had problem with IM+ Pro and their support doesn't act at all. But with free software app I don't need to relay on official support and I can just support it by myself or buy support from third party. There is no proprietary lock up. I'm also supprised how well this app does work. I tried to turn off app and then ping my xmpp client  and I get that message immediatelly.

For some reason  the MailListWidget is no longer available and I can't get it to install on my Note 7. So I now have no unread email list widget. Which means I'm using the standard Android email client. Why  after all these years have you not built a mail list widget?! I have always liked having a list of new emails listed right on my home screen and I could select the one I wanted to read. Now I have to open the client  hit each folder to find out what new emails I have. Love K-9  HATE the lack of widget support. Since K-9 doesn't meet my needs any more  I give it a 3 instead of the 5 I would give it on my Note 4 where the third party widget still worked.

I don't think you need them both - the shortcut doesn't need an icon because you know it's there and then you could then use the 'pin' icon as the primary reminder  rather than the star - which is less intuitive.] I hope you don't mind the suggestions.,September 15 2015,5,4,

There are lot of implication in favour of user. Problem with IM+ or other xmpp + OTR app was that I never wasn't sure if OTR is done on my cellphone or on their servers. I didn't know if keys are stored also in their servers or only in my device. But with this application because of free software nature you have source codes so you are able to audit code if you want. Also in previous I had problem with IM+ Pro and their support doesn't act at all. But with free software app I don't need to relay on official support and I can just support it by myself or buy support from third party. There is no proprietary lock up. I'm also supprised how well this app does work. I tried to turn off app and then ping my xmpp client  and I get that message immediatelly. I'm not sure how this is possible  I'll look at the source code  but it's possible that you guys are using push notification or something? if so how?

7bf24a35-afc9-11e6-9e09-c4b301cdf627,de.srlabs.snoopsnitch,SnoopSnitch App seems to be working as advertised. YOU MUST pay special attention to the prerequisites before installing. They are rather unusual and not many users will meet the hardware and software requirements. For instance  your phone must have a Qualcomm chipset. It also must be rooted. And finally  it should be running on stock Android 4.1 or later although some custom roms apparently work. That being said  it should be noted that SRLabs should be commended for the effort. Same outfit that broke the BadUsb fiasco. They seem to be focused on awareness of issues like stingrays  etc as well as issues like BadUsb. I'm not sure why some people can't get it to work. My first suggestion would be to make sure it's granted SU access. I know from experience that the request for SU access just flashes across the screen sometimes and if you're not looking you can miss it,January 02 2015,5,5,

Up to now  the most feasible way to manage them on my server was Thunderbird together with Lightning/SOGo. But  of course  this only works on the PC and I'd like to have an app to access what I created. The sync works  but the app doesn't support the assigned categories  which I need for sorting and filtering. Unfortunately  it only supports filtering based on predefined criteria like progress  priority  and start and due date  which is not enough for a big pile of TODOs.

c948fd91-b01e-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android,I really like this application. It has some great plugins (TTS text-to-speech)  lots of customization  and the ability to pull books from multiple sources. It is my main 'go to' e-reader. However  the only weakness is in the lack of support for tables in ePub documents. I'm not really sure why this is  as tables certainly aren't a recent addition to the HTML/ePub markup. I have many e-books (travel guides  technical publications  etc...) that present information in tables  and when rendered by FBReader  it is a useless mess. I know that there are some HTML purists who feel that tables -- like the <frameset> and <blink> tags -- are an abomination and all layout must be via <div> or <span>...but I hope the FBReader people are not among them. Support for tables would be enough to move my review to 5 stars. If it were a feature of the Premium app  that would be reason enough for me to purchase it.,September 05 2015,4,5,

Sometimes the problem stops if I'm patient  other times I have to use my moment of usability to restart.

7cd4d694-afc9-11e6-8cde-c4b301cdf627,com.twofours.surespot,Open source IM with PGP like security features Surespot is a free and end-to-end encrypted instant messenger for Android and iOS. Both clients and the server are open source. No phone numbers are needed for registration (though this can be also a drawback for larger adoption). Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default so the user does not have to make the decision or effort to do it (apart from verifying long term keys). Biggest drawbacks are the lack of a group chat  no support for multi device syncing and no perfect forward secrecy in the protocol. Also I am not aware of any audits on the code but at least it is open for anyone to see. In conclusion Surespot is a good open source option if you are satisfied with similar security as in PGP but if you want something more modern like forward secrecy and encrypted group chats there are other open source alternatives that deliver those.,March 26 2015,4,5,

7cd4d694-afc9-11e6-8cde-c4b301cdf627,com.twofours.surespot,Open source IM with PGP like security features Surespot is a free and end-to-end encrypted instant messenger for Android and iOS. Both clients and the server are open source. No phone numbers are needed for registration (though this can be also a drawback for larger adoption). Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default so the user does not have to make the decision or effort to do it (apart from verifying long term keys). Biggest drawbacks are the lack of a group chat  no support for multi device syncing and no perfect forward secrecy in the protocol. Also I am not aware of any audits on the code but at least it is open for anyone to see. In conclusion Surespot is a good open source option if you are satisfied with similar security as in PGP but if you want something more modern like forward secrecy and encrypted group chats there are other open source alternatives that deliver those.,March 26 2015,4,5,

I never know if it's going to work or not  but I keep using it on the off chance it does load right. I can add shows to my queue but whether or not it actually loads right is a gamble. Sometimes I load things  give up  and a couple hours later it starts to play out of the blue (really nice when I'm in situations like a work meeting  and my phone starts blaring) I'm giving it 2 stars because when it works  it's so nice (I can listen to entire programs  which I like since I have a few I like to listen start to finish  like Morning Edition) but honestly NPR - with the constant reviews and complaints about how buggy this app is  you really need to get it together and fix it. I've been using the NPR app for years now  and the revamp they did about 1.5 years ago ruined it.

This happens almost everytime I open the application. I wish the trending section had videos from all over the world not only country specific ones.

The automatic quality setting when you click the video can also be improved by not playing a 144p video when you can set a 1080p/1440p video manually without any buffering. Sometimes it can also take a long time to load the homepage too. Other than that  the application has been behaving itself quite well.,January 08 2017,4,6,

3f3dc296-d618-11e6-883f-fa163e345ce9,com.google.android.youtube,Getting Better The latest update has gotten better compared to the previous versions but sometimes YouTube detects that there is no internet connection when there is. This happens almost everytime I open the application. I wish the trending section had videos from all over the world not only country specific ones. It could have been better if YouTube could better change quality settings without stuttering. The automatic quality setting when you click the video can also be improved by not playing a 144p video when you can set a 1080p/1440p video manually without any buffering. Sometimes it can also take a long time to load the homepage too. Other than that  the application has been behaving itself quite well.,January 08 2017,4,6,
